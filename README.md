 Above responsive screen-shot simulation of my website from : [https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://sonjawisnotavailable.github.io/p2-Match-That/index.html]

Match-That is a fictional, new website that has currently one quiz available, but more on the way!
 
 Please note I did not use favicon for this website either as I am trying to find ways to design my websites on my own as part of my learning, I am aware I have a lot to learn still.

# User Experience (UX)
    
    
  

 ## User Experience 
  This website is specifically targeted to those who wish to have fun taking part in a quiz. 
  The game app is designed deliberately without a score system/tracker as I thought it would be more enjoyable.
    
   
    
 ### Key Information: 
    
    
  - Historical information pertaining to the company. 
  - A coming-soon page which details future projects.
  - Social media links for connecting to the audience and a news-letter for a community development.
  - Play here section
  - Home Page
    
       
               
   ### Client Goals: 
        
        
   - To view this website on different devices.
   - To take advantage of the news-letter option to keep up-to-date with the developers. 
            
   ### First time Visitor Goals:
             
          
   - I want to easily navigate the website. 
   - I want to understand the game.
   - I want to find ways to contact the developer/game maker to connect.
           

   ### Returning Visitor Goals: 
              
   - I want to be familiar with the layout of the website. 
   - I want to find it quick and easy to contact the company. 
   - I want to play the game and look for new games if available.
                         
            
  ### Frequent User:
             
   - I want to be able to know the website layout and navigate where I need to go/contact the company and enjoy playing the quiz.
           
  ## Design: 
  ### Colours: 
             
       
I visited the website coolors, (https://coolors.co/) to give me inspiration, however I chose my own colour palette for this website as I wanted light colours that suited the footer banner I chose. 
             
  ### Typography: 
  
  I used Cabin Condensed and Porter from Google Fonts for the website.

   ## Wireframe Design Using Balsamiq: 
        
  I used Balsamiq a little bit to help plan out the design of the website. I deviated from it as when challenges arose through coding and different styling was needed. I am happy with my easy-to-use layout.

## Spell Check
    
I used the Grammarly extension and app ["https://app.grammarly.com/ddocs/1889981952"] to spell-check and check grammar on my website. 
    
    
   ## Future Implementations:              
I would definitely take more time to learn as much as I can about JavaScript and I would implement more games into the website, such as Nature Edition as mentioned in the Coming Soon page. I would also like to add audio cues and markers for correct or incorrect answers.    
             
             
   ## Technology Used: 
             
             
   ### Languages Used: 
             
             
 HTML, CSS and JavaScript were the languages I used in making this website.
             
             
            
  ## Frameworks, Libraries and Programs Used: 
           
  - Github was to used to save and store code. 
  - Google Fonts was used to import fonts for my website. 
  - Iconography was imported from Font Awesome. 
  - W3 schools was used to learn and implement code.
  - YouTube was heavily used to learn and implement JavaScript.
  - Balsamiq was used to create the basic wireframe design of the website. 
             
             
  ## Deployment: 
            
  I used GitHub Pages to deploy the website.
                 
             
  ### To Deploy Using GitHub Pages: 
             
             
             
  - Login/Sign- Up to Github. 
  - Find the respitory for the website. 
  - Click on "Settings". 
  - Select "Main branch" and choose "Save". 
  - The website is now live. 
                 
 ## Testing:
           
   I tested my website out on my laptop, my computer, my phone, relative's phones and tablets and on my Xbox. 
   The website ran nicely on all devices. 
   
   I used [https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/"] 
   
   to perform HTML and CSS testing. 
   
   I used ["https://www.webpagetest.org/lighthouse"]
   
  
 
I also used Wave Evaluation Tool Extension (https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) 
My initial evaluating with Wave came up with numberous errors, all of which were swiftly corrected. However, as seen below, my hidden 404 page linked to the star icon as seen below shows and empty link error :

   ### Performance:
   
   
  ## Bugs Found 
          
 At the beginning there were numerous bugs, ranging from buttons not working, responsiveness, layout and repetitive coding. These bugs were due to my own poor concentration and poor revision.
I could not move the "Start" button after the quiz begins, however I intend on studying intensely to learn from my mistakes as this bug was not resolved.

                    
  ## Credits
  
  I relied hugely on Code Institute's Love Math Walk Through project and also numerous YouTube Software Developers, in particular :
  - ('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k&t=1117s')

  
  ### Code Used
          
Some of the coding I have learned and inspired my own is from such sites as:

Used : (https://www.w3schools.in/html/blink-tag) to learn how to do the "play here" animation.

A lot of my code was learned through reading "How To's" from w3schools.
I re-used code from my previous project for layout and structure of my html and css files.
I followed tutorials from YouTube from, again ('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riDzcEQbX6k&t=1117s') Which was essential to my understanding of JavaScript step-by-step.


  
### Media

The icons were taken from font-awesome [https://fontawesome.com/]

The fonts were imported from Google Fonts [https://fonts.google.com/]

The website's footer banner was downloaded from [https://www.freepik.com/free-photos-vectors/footer-banner] creator: "starline".


### Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my family for their patience on this new journey I am under-taking. 
I would like to thank my fellow students who are all very supportive. 
To the staff at Code Institute who are incredibly quick to respond and point me in the right direction.
